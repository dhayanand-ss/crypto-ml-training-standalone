# ✅ Vast AI Setup - COMPLETE

## All Steps Completed Successfully!

### ✅ Step 1: Created `.env` file
- File created with your Vast AI API key
- Location: `c:\Users\dhaya\crypto-ml-training-standalone\.env`

### ✅ Step 2: Updated `docker-compose.airflow.yml`
- Uncommented `VASTAI_API_KEY: ${VASTAI_API_KEY}` in `airflow-webserver` service
- Added `VASTAI_API_KEY: ${VASTAI_API_KEY}` to `airflow-scheduler` service
- Removed obsolete `version: '3.8'` field

### ✅ Step 3: Restarted Airflow Containers
- Postgres: ✅ Running and healthy
- Airflow Init: ✅ Completed
- Airflow Webserver: ✅ Running (port 8080)
- Airflow Scheduler: ✅ Running

### ✅ Step 4: Verified API Key is Loaded
- **Scheduler container**: ✅ API key confirmed
- **Webserver container**: ✅ API key confirmed

## 🎯 Current Status

**All Airflow services are running with the Vast AI API key configured!**

### Container Status:
```
✅ postgres              - Up 17 minutes (healthy)
✅ airflow-webserver     - Up 7 minutes (port 8080)
✅ airflow-scheduler     - Up 6 minutes
```

### API Key Verification:
```
✅ VASTAI_API_KEY is loaded in both webserver and scheduler containers
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Access Airflow UI**: http://localhost:8080
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

2. **Test the DAG**:
   - Go to the `training_pipeline` DAG
   - Trigger it manually
   - Check the `vast_ai_train` task logs
   - You should **NOT** see: "VASTAI_API_KEY environment variable not set"
   - Instead, you should see: "Starting Vast.ai Instance Creation"

3. **Monitor Training**:
   - The DAG will create Vast AI instances
   - Monitor the training progress
   - Check logs for any issues

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `.env` - Created with API key
2. ✅ `docker-compose.airflow.yml` - Updated with VASTAI_API_KEY configuration
3. ✅ `VASTAI_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Documentation created
4. ✅ `SETUP_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## ✨ Summary

**Everything is configured and ready!** The Vast AI API key is now available to all Airflow tasks, and the `vast_ai_train` task should work without errors.

You can now run your training pipeline DAG and it will be able to create Vast AI instances for distributed ML training.
