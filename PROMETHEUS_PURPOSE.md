# What is the Function of Prometheus in This Project?

## Overview

Prometheus is a **monitoring and metrics collection system** that continuously scrapes, stores, and queries metrics from your FastAPI ML inference service. It acts as the **observability layer** for your machine learning application.

---

## Primary Functions

### 1. **Metrics Collection** 📊

Prometheus automatically collects metrics from your FastAPI application every 15 seconds (configurable). Your FastAPI app exposes metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint, and Prometheus scrapes this endpoint to gather data.

**What metrics are collected:**

#### **ML Model Metrics** (Custom metrics from your FastAPI app):
- **`ml_predictions_total`** - Total number of predictions made
  - Labels: `model_name`, `version`, `status` (success/error)
  - Example: Track how many predictions each model has made

- **`ml_predictions_duration_seconds`** - Prediction latency/response time
  - Labels: `model_name`, `version`
  - Example: Monitor how fast your models are making predictions

- **`ml_model_load_errors_total`** - Number of model loading failures
  - Labels: `model_name`, `version`
  - Example: Track when models fail to load from MLflow

- **`ml_active_models`** - Number of models currently loaded in memory
  - Labels: `model_name`, `version`
  - Example: Monitor which models are active and ready for inference

#### **HTTP Metrics** (Automatic from FastAPI Instrumentator):
- Request counts by method, status code, endpoint
- Request duration/latency
- Response sizes
- Active connections

### 2. **Time-Series Data Storage** 💾

Prometheus stores all collected metrics as **time-series data**, meaning:
- Each metric is stored with a timestamp
- You can query historical data (e.g., "How many predictions were made in the last hour?")
- Data is retained for 15 days (configurable in `prometheus-values.yaml`)

**Example queries you can run:**
```promql
# Total predictions in last hour
rate(ml_predictions_total[1h])

# Average prediction latency
avg(ml_predictions_duration_seconds)

# Error rate
rate(ml_predictions_total{status="error"}[5m])
```

---

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerting** 🚨

Prometheus enables you to:
- **Monitor** your ML service health in real-time
- **Set up alerts** when things go wrong (via AlertManager)
- **Track performance** trends over time
- **Identify issues** before they become critical

**Example monitoring scenarios:**
- Alert when prediction error rate exceeds 5%
- Alert when model load failures occur
- Alert when prediction latency exceeds 1 second
- Monitor model usage patterns

---

### 4. **Integration with Grafana** 📈

Prometheus serves as the **data source** for Grafana dashboards:
- Grafana queries Prometheus to create visual dashboards
- You can create graphs, charts, and visualizations of your ML metrics
- Real-time monitoring dashboards for your team

**Example dashboards you can create:**
- Prediction throughput over time
- Model latency distribution
- Error rates by model
- Active models status
- API request patterns

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **FastAPI Application** runs and serves ML models
2. **Metrics are generated** automatically:
   - Every prediction increments `ml_predictions_total`
   - Every prediction records latency in `ml_predictions_duration_seconds`
   - Model loads/errors update respective counters
3. **FastAPI exposes metrics** at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`
4. **Prometheus scrapes** the `/metrics` endpoint every 15 seconds
5. **Prometheus stores** the metrics in its time-series database
6. **You can query** metrics via Prometheus UI or Grafana dashboards

- Track error rates per model
- Monitor service availability

### 3. **Capacity Planning**
- Understand prediction volume trends
- Plan for scaling based on usage patterns
- Identify peak usage times

### 4. **Debugging & Troubleshooting**

## Example Metrics You Can Track

### Prediction Metrics
```promql
# Total predictions per model
sum(ml_predictions_total) by (model_name)

# Success rate
sum(rate(ml_predictions_total{status="success"}[5m])) / 
sum(rate(ml_predictions_total[5m]))

# Average latency per model
avg(ml_predictions_duration_seconds) by (model_name)

# 95th percentile latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, ml_predictions_duration_seconds)
```

### Model Health Metrics
```promql
# Active models count
sum(ml_active_models)

# Model load errors
sum(rate(ml_model_load_errors_total[5m])) by (model_name)
```

### API Metrics
```promql
# Request rate
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Error rate
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])
```

## Why Prometheus is Important for ML Services

1. **Visibility**: You can't improve what you can't measure
2. **Reliability**: Catch issues before they impact users
3. **Performance**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize
4. **Debugging**: Understand what happened when things go wrong
5. **Compliance**: Track model usage and performance for auditing
